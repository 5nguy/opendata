Miller Fleming built the present-day mill in 1827. He innovated by building an imposing Anglo-Saxon type mill, unique in all of Québec.Although it stopped being used around 1891, the mill was summarily restored by the Burroughs Wellcome firm in 1930. LaSalle acquired it, as well as the surrounding land, in 1947. Classified as a historical monument on January 13, 1983, by Québec’s Ministère des Affaires culturelles, the mill was restored in 1990.

"Ruelle bleue-verte","https://montreal.ca/en/places/ruelle-bleue-verte","What is a blue-green alley? A blue-green alley is an alley specially designed to improve stormwater management. The roof drains of one or more buildings are not connected to the sewer system, to let stormwater benefit the local ecosystem. Advantages of this method include greater resilience to heavy rainfall, reduced heat islands and backflow into streams and the river, and increased biodiversity. Find out more about the Blue-Green Alleys (in French) project and discover the interpretation signs on site. Bâtiment 7 Le 7 À NOUS, the organization that owns Bâtiment 7, is overseeing the project. It is using the alley to manage the rainwater that runs off its building in a resilient and ecological way. This new approach highlights our willingness to do things differently to save our planet. It can inspire other Montréal boroughs and Québec municipalities to take similar steps. CN shops The blue-green alley is the first in a series of future parks and green spaces that will completely transform the former CN shops area of Pointe-Saint-Charles into a district where modernity and ecological transition go hand in hand.

"Square Phillips","https://montreal.ca/en/places/square-phillips","Square Phillips is a charming green oasis in downtown Montréal with a unique and historical view of Rue Sainte-Catherine, one of Montréal’s most famous shopping streets. Its location on the corner of Avenue Union and Rue Sainte-Catherine Ouest makes it a perfect place to meet friends or relax.The square got a makeover between October 2020 and June 2022. It’s now bigger, greener and more comfortable. Its lawn with seven fountain streams enhances the historic monument to Edward VII and the square’s atmosphere in the summertime. Benches integrated into green islands create a friendly space with lots of seating. Its granite cobblestones, some 30 trees and a number of plants and shrubs make it a beautiful square.A number of cultural events are held at Square Phillips.HistorySquare Phillips played an important role in the birth of Rue Sainte-Catherine’s economic and commercial growth. The square was built in 1842 in a wealthy residential area, which attracted the area’s first large stores.In 189, Henry Morgan moved his company (today, the Hudson Bay Company) near the square, as did Henry Birks, who, several years later, built his headquarters there (Henry Birks and Son). At the centre of the square is a monument to Edward VII built by Québec sculptor Louis-Philippe Hébert, a gift from the Birks family in 1914.On the south side of the square, the 10-storey Canada Cement Building was built in 1921. The building was considered ahead of its time as the first building made completely out of concrete in Montréal and the city’s first skyscraper with underground parking, considering that car traffic was not as heavy at the time.In 2012, on the south side, the city built a commemorative monument to victims of the fire at the nearby Blue Bird Cafe in 1972 in honour of the 40th anniversary of the tragedy.","2020-10-13","2022-05-31","Ville-Marie","Parks and gardens","Park","","Free Wi-Fi","Stroller-friendly,Drop-off zone","Arts and Sports",""," ","","","","","","Square Phillips","Rue Sainte-Catherine Ouest, between Avenue Union, Rue Cathcart and Place Phillips",,,"Montréal",45.503670081684,-73.568556967021,299442.6,5040418.8

"Parc Pasquale-Gattuso","https://montreal.ca/en/places/parc-pasquale-gattuso","Park for taking in the natural scenery or enjoying outdoor activities.Microforests ProjectAs part of the second edition of the City of Montreal’s participatory budget, the Rivière-des-Prairies-Pointe-aux-Trembles borough will create four small microforest areas in the Pasquale-Gattuso Park sector in 2024. This project, stemming from citizen proposals, will contribute to the greening of your neighborhood.What is a microforest?A microforest involves the compact and very dense planting of several small-sized native trees and shrubs, in a way that recreates a natural forest more resilient to climatic challenges (wind, cold, frost, heat waves, etc.). This planting technique, increasingly used in Montreal’s parks, allows trees to grow about 10 times faster while promoting biodiversity.A Cool IslandThe planting zones will be located in the southern part of the park, in its large linear section. In addition to substantially increasing the forest cover, thus contributing to the fight against climate change, these new micro-forests will bring numerous benefits:Creation of a cool island;Greater biodiversity (birds, pollinators, etc.);Natural visual screen between the residential and industrial zones.A total of about 1,600 native trees and shrubs will be planted. The chosen native species will be very diverse (red oak, silver maple, shrubs, black cherry, serviceberry, black chokeberry, white pine, gooseberry, birch, dogwood, etc.). The soil will also be covered with mulch and compost. Four types of forests will be implemented: avian forest, pioneer forest, noble forest, and dense forest.","2019-09-05","2024-08-27","Rivière-des-Prairies–Pointe-aux-Trembles","Parks and gardens","Park","","Picnic area,Drinking fountain,Free Wi-Fi","","Arts and Sports",""," Schedule [Lundi, ouverture:06:00, fermeture:23:00,Mardi, ouverture:06:00, fermeture:23:00,Mercredi, ouverture:06:00, fermeture:23:00,Jeudi, ouverture:06:00, fermeture:23:00,Vendredi, ouverture:06:00, fermeture:23:00,Samedi, ouverture:06:00, fermeture:23:00,Dimanche, ouverture:06:00, fermeture:23:00]","","","","","","Parc Pasquale-Gattuso","11770 Place Gilles-Trottier",,"H1E6G6","Montréal",45.637568138233,-73.571370284997,299236,5055299.3

"Avenue du Mont-Royal","https://montreal.ca/en/places/avenue-du-mont-royal","Avenue du Mont-Royal will be a pedestrian-only zone this summer. Just like last year, it has been made into a slow zone. Cyclists, skateboarders, scooterists and in-line skaters can use it so long as they drive slowly and yield to pedestrians at all times.  Pedestrian zone dates Between Boulevard Saint-Laurent and Rue Saint-Denis: June 5 to October 14 Between Rue Saint-Denis and Avenue De Lorimier: June 5 to August 26 Setup and removal The road will be closed to traffic on May 28 to allow for the gradual installation of signage. Setup will follow in the next few days. It will also be necessary to allow a few days for removal when the pedestrian-only zone ends. Slow zone On the avenue, pedestrians always have priority. However, cyclists, skateboarders, scooterists and in-line skaters are welcome, provided that they drive slowly. Once again this year, measures will be put in place to promote safe and harmonious cohabitation. Rules The use of motorcycle-like electric bicycles, scooters with flat floors and electric scooters is prohibited. Bicycles and other light modes, whether electrically assisted or not (scooters, scooters, skateboards, in-line skates, etc.), as well as deliveries by electrically assisted bicycle or cargo bike, are permitted, provided they are driven slowly. Accessibility for seniors and people with reduced mobility To facilitate access to avenue du Mont-Royal for seniors and people with functional limitations, three free transportation services will be available. Société de transport de Montréal (STM)Adapted transportation will go to the Mont-Royal metro station. Eva Coop (to and from the avenue)May 28 to October 18 (7 days a week, 9 a.m. to 9 p.m.) For people aged 65 and over or with reduced mobility in the Rachel/du Parc/Saint-Joseph/D’Iberville quadrilateral. Up to 2 trips per day, 2 times per week. Reserve at 514-228-3979. Un vélo une ville (to get around on the avenue) June 5 to October 14 (7 days a week, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.) For seniors and people with functional limitations. Pick one up or reserve at 438-378-0758. Please note that adapted transportation will be maintained via the cross-streets, and that all terraces must be universally accessible. Signage Please pay close attention to all signage, especially no parking signs at blocked intersections and at the midpoint of certain perpendicular streets to allow vehicles making U-turns to pass. In addition, the direction of traffic on Rue Marquette (between Avenue du Mont-Royal Est and Rue Gilford) and Rue Cartier (between du Avenue Mont-Royal Est and Rue Gilford) will be reversed. Bus routes Buses will take alternative routes. Visit stm.info/rues-pietonnes for details. Morning collections, deliveries and street cleaning Collections, deliveries and clean-ups on Avenue du Mont-Royal will take place between 7 a.m. and 11 a.m. in the morning. Items for pickup should be put out between 7 a.m. and 10 a.m. on collection day. Clean-up brigades will be patrolling the avenue to pick up litter. Waste sorting Waste sorting stations will be installed on the avenue this summer. While enjoying the pedestrian-only zone, be sure to put your recyclables and compostables in the right places! Garbage cans at intersections To keep garbage truck traffic and the nuisances that come with it (risk of collision, noise and odours) out of the pedestrian-only zone, garbage cans have been relocated to intersections.

Just like last year, it has been transformed into a “slow zone,” meaning that cyclists, skateboarders, scooters and in-line skaters can use it as long as they drive slowly and yield priority to pedestrians at all times. Motorcycle-like electric bikes, scooters with flat floors and electric scooters are prohibited. Start dateBetween Boulevard Saint-Laurent and Rue Saint-Hubert: May 14 to October 15 Accessibility for seniors and people with reduced mobilityOnce again this year, measures will be taken to promote harmonious and safe cohabitation. All sidewalk cafés must be universally accessible. In addition, all Avenue Duluth intersections can be used as drop-off points for adapted transportation. SignageThe road will be closed to traffic on May 6 to allow for the gradual installation of signage. Other adjustments will follow over the next few days. A few days will be needed to revert the street for car traffic once the pedestrian-only period is over. Please pay close attention to signage. The direction of traffic on Rue Rivard, between Rue Rachel and Avenue Duluth, will be reversed.Morning collections, deliveries and street cleaning Collections, deliveries and street cleaning on Avenue Duluth will take place between 7 and 11 a.m. in the morning. Collections must be put out between 7 a.m. and 10 a.m. on collection day.Waste sortingWaste sorting stations will be installed on Avenue Duluth this summer during pedestrian-only season. Be sure to put your recyclables and compostables in the right places! Garbage cans at intersections To avoid garbage truck traffic and the nuisances that come with it (risk of collision, noise and odours), the mid-street garbage cans in the pedestrian zone have been relocated to intersections. Street fairs Three street fairs to help promote local businesses will take place on the avenue: June 12 to 16, August 17 to 18 and September 21 to 22. During these street fairs, terraces will exceptionally be open until 11 p.m. Liaison officer Contact the liaison officer with comments, complaints and suggestions: pietonnisationsplateau@montreal.ca | 311","2024-05-07","2024-05-07","Le Plateau-Mont-Royal","Sports and recreation","Rue piétonne","","","","Maintenance and Traffic",""," ","","","","","","Avenue Duluth Est","Entre le boulevard Saint-Laurent et la rue Saint-Hubert",,"H2W1J1","Montréal",45.519753,-73.576839,298797.1,5042206.7

"Parc Raymond","https://montreal.ca/en/places/parc-raymond","Parc Raymond is a park for relaxing.Brand-new conceptThe Parc Raymond area where the pool and skatepark were located will be completely transformed.The new park development will be divided into two main sections: the skatepark and the splash pad area.Skatepark areaSkateboarding spaceThe skatepark will give skateboarders an opportunity to create original tricks and runs. In 2019, as part of a school project, youngsters from Grand Heron school expressed interest in the project to redevelop the skatepark in Parc Raymond. Enthusiastic about the youngsters’ interest in the project, the borough set up a residents’ committee with the collaboration of the Montreal Skateboard Association. Through this committee, LaSalle skateboarders had the chance to discuss their interests and expectations for the new facilities. The skatepark will be built on a concrete surface allowing for the use of scooters or skateboards. Piazzetta spaceLocated between the school and the skatepark, the piazzetta will be sports lovers’ favourite place. Benches will be installed so that they can take a short break between two tricks. Trees will also be planted to provide some shade.Splash pad areaSplash pad spaceParc Raymond pool had become outdated and was damaged as well, so it wasn’t feasible to repair it. Faced with this fact, the borough decided to set up a large-scale splash pad area. This space will be as large as the L’Aquaciel play area, located on the grounds of the Centre sportif Dollard-St-Laurent. These facilities, which are sure to be very popular, will serve residents living south of the Canal de l’Aqueduc. Play spaceA play area with ground markings will allow users to express themselves and have fun.Relaxation space This area will be appreciated by families wanting to relax under the umbrellas.The strong presence of organic colours and shapes, both on the equipment and on the ground, will visually unify the two large areas. The greenery chosen will contribute to this mix through the variety of textures and colours.Parc Raymond chalet will also be renovated.

In addition, the woodland offers 2,1 km of walking trails (including the one leading to bassin de la Brunante). The total area of the woodland including the Parc Marcel-Laurin is 37,4 ha.The wooded area of ​​Parc Marcel-Laurin is the first category A municipal natural site listed to date in the Directory of Protected Natural Environments of the Agglomeration of Montreal. This site was entered in the Directory in December 2010, at the request of the Arrondissement de Saint-Laurent.Educational activitiesThanks to the collaboration of Éco-quartier de Saint-Laurent and the Comité Écologique du Grand Montréal, the woodland is constantly enhanced through environmental initiatives such as plantations, cleaning chores and discovery activities, which add to its attractions. Educational activities and events relating to the protection of nature and biodiversity are organized there throughout the year. To stay up-to-date on the program, subscribe to the Saint-Laurent and Éco-quartier de Saint-Laurent Facebook page.Site of ornithological interestThanks to the variety of birds that can be observed there, the wooded area of ​​Parc Marcel-Laurin and the Brunante basin are sites of interest for ornithology enthusiasts. Ornithology enthusiasts are also invited to register. their observations in the eBird Quebec database. This portal allows ornithologists in Quebec to help monitor bird populations, while providing interactive data visualization tools.FloraThe various forest stands as well as the wetlands found in the woods constitute an important biodiversity. In addition to animals, there are over 191 plant species, including 38 tree species, 41 shrub species and 112 herbaceous species.Rich in wetlands and wasteland favoring wildlife, including pollinators and snakes, the wooded area of ​​Parc Marcel-Laurin lists a variety of plants that can be observed along the trails and in the forest.In addition to the list of plant species are common buckthorn and buckthorn (Rhammus cathartica et frangula) and common reed (Phragmites australis subsp. Australis). These invasive alien plants must, however, be eradicated as they supplant other species that naturally live in woodlands and their wasteland. Since 2005, a woodlot enhancement process has been underway in order to control these harmful species, restore the environment and maintain various infrastructures.DonorsTo date, many donors and collaborators have contributed to the protection of this exceptional environment.

Now, it’s only for neighbourhood cars in order to reduce traffic and speed limits, as well as making the area safer for cyclists and pedestrians. The new configuration has created welcoming areas that are perfect places to meet a friend or relax. ObjectivesMake the street a safe, green and welcoming gathering place that makes Pointe-Saint-Charles a more attractive place. Promote safe sharing of space among pedestrians, cyclists and drivers. Create an instinctive link with the Lachine Canal for area residents and an attractive entrance to Pointe-Saint-Charles for people coming from the Lachine Canal.FeaturesA shared northbound lane for traffic just for local travel in order to reduce traffic and speed limits, as well as making the area safer for cyclists and pedestrians.

"Parc Baldwin outdoor swimming pool","https://montreal.ca/en/places/parc-baldwin-outdoor-swimming-pool","Consultation activity on the construction of a new swimming pool at Parc Baldwin (June 19, 2024).Le Plateau-Mont-Royal held a public consultation on its project to build a new swimming pool in Parc Baldwin on June 19, at 6 p.m. in the Plateau Room at 201 Avenue Laurier Est. The purpose of the event was to give a brief progress report on the project and discuss certain design elements of the new pool. The elements discussed at the fall 2023 information session were not revisited. Overview (in French) (progress - status - universal changing room) Participants’ comments (in French) (wading pool - swimming areas - rest area - recreation area) Universal changing room: FAQs (in French) Comments from participants were collected, consolidated and passed on to the professionals in charge of designing the pool.Information meeting on the construction of a new swimming pool at Parc Baldwin (September 25, 2023) Le Plateau-Mont-Royal invited the public to an information session on the construction of a new swimming pool in Baldwin Park on September 25, 2023 at 7 p.m., at the borough’s art centre. Webcast (in French) Overview (in French) FAQ (in French) ContextThe pool facilities (pool, wading pool, filtration system, beach, welcome centre), which were built in 1964, have reached the end of their lifespan. The filtration system is outdated and no longer complied with regulatory standards. The existing mechanical room was no longer large enough to contain new filtration and water treatment equipment. Given that the project is on an unused elimination site (former garbage dump), it is subject to article 65 of Québec’s Environment Quality Act.The facilities are subject to ground movement due to settling and decomposition of backfill materials. The foundation of the pavilion is collapsing, and a number of cracks and raised areas have been observed. Consequently, the walls of the building are cracking and are misaligned towards the outside. The building has major structural defects and would not be able to withstand renovations. The new projectThe new pool will be located in the northwestern sector of the park, where there is currently a soccer field. On the site of the old pool, a new natural soccer field will be built and the pavilion will be torn down. The future 50-metre pool with swimming lanes will be able to accommodate a greater number of swimmers. A wading pool and a partially shaded beach are also planned.A call for tenders for professional services was launched in autumn 2023 for the design, plans and specifications. A public presentation of the pool design and layout is planned prior to launching the call for tenders to build the pool. This presentation will be followed by a period for comments and questions. Thereafter, the call for tenders to build the pool is expected to be launched in spring 2025, with construction starting in late summer 2025. The desired opening date is 2027. Please note that play fountains are open in the northern portion of the park.","2021-05-05","2024-07-24","Le Plateau-Mont-Royal","Sports and recreation","Outdoor swimming pool","Swimming","","","Arts and Sports",""," ","","","","numéro: 5148723533","","Parc Baldwin outdoor swimming pool","4355 Rue Fullum",,"H2H1N1","Montréal",45.534995813829,-73.563731353722,299822.5,5043899.7

Proof of your project’s compliance, before it is carried out, protects you from the civil and penal consequences that could result from failure to meet the requirements of the bylaws.Assistance from the Direction de l’aménagement urbain et des services aux entreprises (DAUSE)To check whether standards are applicable to your project and whether a permit or certificate is required, in order to ensure that the bylaws are properly understood.

Please note that additional fees may be required during processing, in addition to other permit or certificate applications (e.g. tree cutting).

A review in relation to the National Building Code may also be conducted if the project so requires, in compliance with construction and safety standards. If the application is subject to a discretionary tool (PIIAD, PPCMOI, demolition), an examination by professional urban planning consultants will be carried out. In such cases, a recommendation from the Comité consultatif d’urbanisme (CCU), the urban planning advisory committee, will be required and a resolution will have to be adopted at a meeting of LaSalle’s Borough Council to approve the project. These types of permits or certificates involve an additional delay of at least two (2) months.Issuance of the permit or certificateOnce the examination of your application has been completed and all requirements have been met, the permit or certificate is issued.Start of workYour work, including demolition, can begin only once the permit is issued and must be completed within the specified time frame. Your permit must be posted at the work site.

Explore this questionnaire to discover new ways of consuming, producing, working and living together to address major environmental and social challenges. About - The story of a great transformationThe Pierrefonds library project, which required $20.3 million in investments, was carried out as part of the Programme de rénovation, d’agrandissement et de construction de bibliothèques (RAC) and funded through the Entente sur le développement culturel de Montréal, concluded by the Ville de Montréal and the ministère de la Culture et des Communications. Additional funding of $5 million from the Borough of Pierrefonds-Roxboro was provided for the development of administrative spaces and the addition of documents to the collection, for a total project cost of $25.3 million. In addition to the new and renewed services, the surface area of the new library has also been doubled, totalling 3967m2.In 2012, it was officially announced the Pierrefonds Library would undergo a major renovation. There were two main issues with the old library: the lack of space to house its collection of over 120,000 books and manuscripts and the need to modernize the services offered to its visitors by providing an environment adapted to contemporary needs. In 2013, through an architectural competition, the jury selected the consortium Chevalier Morales architects and DMA architects. The design of the library won the prestigious Award of Excellence from Canadian Architect Magazine before even breaking ground.The library officially opened to the grand public on May 23rd, 2019.Awards and recognition2023: Distinction Award by the Association de l’enveloppe et des revêtements muraux du Québec.2021: The Year Jury’s Favourite (coup de coeur) of the Association des architectes en pratique privée du Québec.
